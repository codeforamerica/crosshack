A framework for instructors to share their workshop curricula, assets, slides, handouts, etc. Makes it easier for groups to reproduce presentations.

Code for America fellows undergo intense training in January before they head to their host cities in February. While in their cities in Feb, Code for America fellows have an opportunity to give presentations. Skill Camp is a tool to allow fellows to more easily give presentations by providing documentation from the original presenter.

All your friends are having a pet party on the Fourth of July! You are opening an animal shelter to make sure all 100 of your friends have a pet by that time. You have one month to open your animal shelter in the best location for your friends to get to you and get excited about having new pets.

Because of what's around them, the place you pick is important. If you put your animal shelter closer to parks, bus stops, pet stores, vets offices, or areas with lots of people, your pets will be adopted faster! To look at where each of these things are, click the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Hurry though -- you only have a month!
