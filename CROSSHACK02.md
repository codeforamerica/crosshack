- Code: https://github.com/codeforamerica/skillcamp
- Live Demo: http://www.skill.camp/
- Presentation: n/a

A framework for instructors to share their workshop curricula, assets, slides, handouts, etc. Makes it easier for groups to reproduce presentations.

Code for America fellows undergo intense training in January before they head to their host cities in February. While in their cities in Feb, Code for America fellows have an opportunity to give presentations. Skill Camp is a tool to allow fellows to more easily give presentations by providing documentation from the original presenter.
